### Arrests At NFL Stadiums

  In this project we hope to examine the relationship between the game times, outcomes, and time of year of an NFL game and the amount of arrests at the stadium during the game. This could provide valuable insight into the public safety ramifications of attending an NFL game. We will investigate the relationship between the amount of crimes committed and home team losses, week of the season, and overtime wins across years for different teams. While we hope to show that these relationships exist, this project could open the doors to others who wish to investigate the root of these relationships. 

  To perform our analysis, we plan on using both visual/graphical analysis and multivariate linear regression models. We plan to create a new variable that looks at the margin of victory (or loss) for each game, and then compare that to the number of arrests made. This new variable will help us visualize whether or not the score of the game has an impact on the amount of arrests. 

  Additionally, we expect to see that some teams consistently have more arrests than other teams.
Furthermore, we expect to see a negative correlation between wins and the amount of arrests made. Seasonally, we expect the number of arrests to rise towards the latter half of the season implying higher rates of crime near November and December. Because of rising tensions that accompany overtime games, we also  expect to see a positive correlation between overtime games and number of arrests.
